# Computer Information Science - 118

## This is my C++ projects from Canada college, Redwood city, CA 

/FinalExamPart2CodingProblem/ - **This program uses the function 'myFactorial' to find the factorial. Here I use the loop, if else statement**

/MidTerm Exam - Part 2 Coding problems/ - **This is a program I use conditional and logical operators. Logical operators allow us to answer the question, "How do we make a choice?"  _Conditional criteria_.  When we write computer programs, we need to have a _complete_ and _clear idea_ of _what the criteria are_ and _how to use them_. In C++ we need _precise_, _logical_, _reality-based criteria_ to _make decisions_, to _choose the right alternative_.**
