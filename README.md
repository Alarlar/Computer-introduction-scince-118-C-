# Computer Information Science - 118

## This is my C++ projects from Canada college, Redwood city, CA 

/FinalExamPart2CodingProblem/ - **This program uses the function 'myFactorial' to find the factorial. Here I use the loop, if else statement**

/MidTerm Exam - Part 2 Coding problems/ - **In this program, I use conditional and logical operators. Logical operators allow us to answer the question, "How do we make a choice?"  _Conditional criteria_.  When we write computer programs, we need to have a _complete_ and _clear idea_ of _what the criteria are_ and _how to use them_. In C++ we need _precise_, _logical_, _reality-based criteria_ to _make decisions_, to _choose the right alternative_.**

/libraryWithManipaulationFunction.cpp/ - **This is a program on how to make a 12x12 table using nested 'for' loops, the _<iomanip>_ library with _setw_ function.**

/NonRecursiveFindingFactorial.cpp/ - **This program finds the factorial without recursion**

/passByRef.cpp/ - **This is a simple program that illustrates how the call by reference method works. In its own words or to quote the book C++ without fear: When we need to pass one information and not a copy, we give its address so that we can access the original, not the copies, without wasting time in copying and being able to manipulate the original source.**


/functionLoop.cpp/ - **This program shows the use of the while loop. With loops we avoid having to enter or copy a block of code several times. The three "loop elements" are important when coding a loop. The _'while'_ loop is a preliminary loop.**
