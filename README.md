# Computer Information Science - 118

## This is my C++ projects from Canada college, Redwood city, CA 

/FinalExamPart2CodingProblem/ - **This program uses the function 'myFactorial' to find the factorial. Here I use the loop, if else statement**

/MidTerm Exam - Part 2 Coding problems/ - **In this program, I use conditional and logical operators. Logical operators allow us to answer the question, "How do we make a choice?"  _Conditional criteria_.  When we write computer programs, we need to have a _complete_ and _clear idea_ of _what the criteria are_ and _how to use them_. In C++ we need _precise_, _logical_, _reality-based criteria_ to _make decisions_, to _choose the right alternative_.**

/libraryWithManipaulationFunction.cpp/ - **This is a program on how to make a 12x12 table using nested 'for' loops, the _<iomanip>_ library with _setw_ function.**

/NonRecursiveFindingFactorial.cpp/ - **This program finds the factorial without recursion**

/passByRef.cpp/ - **This is a simple program that illustrates how the call by reference method works. In its own words or to quote the book C++ without fear: When we need to pass one information and not a copy, we give its address so that we can access the original, not the copies, without wasting time in copying and being able to manipulate the original source.**

/functionLoop.cpp/ - **In this code I use one of my first prototype functions. The functions we fundamentally need are reuse code. A Function is a type of repetition. There are two ways we can use functions:
Prewritten function - found in a library.
The programmer (we) writes one.**

/passAddressIntoFunction.cpp/ - **Function Passing in an Array by a reference/address. Here arrayA will have same address as array passed into function. We are using the same array, not a copy.**

/functionLoop.cpp/ - **This program shows the use of the while loop. With loops we avoid having to enter or copy a block of code several times. The three "loop elements" are important when coding a loop. The _'while'_ loop is a preliminary loop.**

/functionArea.cpp/ - **This is a small program that finds Area of Square with the function**

/ProgCircle.cpp/ - **In this program we can see the use of the 'cmath' library for arithmetic tasks, such as finding areaof circle, volofSphere using the'pow' function.**

/boundsError.cpp/ - **This code may work correctly which is also a problem. If our code is correct, we don't need bounds-checking - that is C++ rule. The language standard does not require that it performs bounds checking. It is no guarantee that it still work the next time in our program. Or that it hasn't overwritten essential data even now, and we just haven't encountered the problems that it is going to cause yet. BoundError can cause Memory corruption and undefined behavior.**
